# cardGame
A simple card game
CPU IS red, Player is green.
Round by round the winner is the one with a higher valued card.
The winner of the round takes both cards.
In case of draw each user gets their card back in their deck.
the winner is the one who empties their oppositions deck.


(I did not worry about styling too much, this was mostly to practice JS classes using decks)
